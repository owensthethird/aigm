ESLINT DISABLING OPTIONS

1. Option 1: Create .env file to disable ESLint
   - Create a .env file in the ui directory
   - Add DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true to disable ESLint during build
   - This is the simplest solution and doesn't require modifying package.json

2. Option 2: Modify webpack configuration
   - Create a config-overrides.js file to override webpack configuration
   - Disable ESLint plugin in the webpack config
   - Requires installing react-app-rewired

3. Option 3: Empty .eslintrc.js file
   - Keep the file but remove all rules and configurations
   - Set up minimal configuration that doesn't cause conflicts

Option 1 is the simplest and most straightforward approach. Let's implement that first.
