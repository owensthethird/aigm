# Codebase Cleanup Plan

## Files to Delete
1. grid-prototype.html - Early prototype using GridStack.js, superseded by grid-layout.html
2. GRID_PANEL_SYSTEM.md - Initial requirements doc, now implemented
3. CSS_GRID_ANIMATIONS.md - Reference guide, contents consolidated into implementation
4. workingmemory.txt - This development journal, to be deleted after cleanup

## Files to Keep
1. grid-layout.html - Current production implementation
2. CHANGELOG.md - New document with comprehensive history

## Summary of Changes
I've created CHANGELOG.md that captures the essential information from all working documents.
The changelog includes:
- Complete feature summary of the grid panel system
- Implementation details of key components 
- Summary of what each legacy document contributed
- Historical record of development decisions

Once the cleanup is complete, the codebase will be more maintainable with only the necessary files.
