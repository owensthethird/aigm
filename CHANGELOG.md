# aiGM System Changelog

## Version 1.0.0 (2025-06-10)

### Grid Panel System - Final Implementation

This version represents the completion of the responsive grid panel system with the following core features:

#### Responsive CSS Grid Layout
- 12x6 grid layout using CSS Grid
- Fully responsive with viewport-relative units (vh)
- Panels properly positioned and sized using grid-column/grid-row properties
- Automatic content reflow with smooth transitions
- Viewport overflow fix with calculated container heights

#### Interactive Functionality
- Drag and drop panel positioning
  - Panel dragging limited to header area
  - Visual feedback during drag operations
  - Grid-based snapping for precise placement
  - Proper cursor state management (grab/grabbing) during drag operations
  - Comprehensive event handling with clean teardown

- Panel resizing
  - Resize from bottom and right edges
  - Visual feedback showing dimensions during resize
  - Grid cell snapping for consistent sizing
  - Smooth content reflow animations during resize

#### Conflict Resolution
- Robust panel conflict detection system
  - Identifies when panels would occupy the same grid cells
  - Visual feedback with red highlights for conflicts
  - Green highlights for valid positions

- Smart panel displacement system
  - Direction-based displacement (right, down, or both)
  - Cascading displacement with recursion handling
  - Proper sorting for displacement order

#### User Interface
- Visual feedback
  - Grid cell highlights during interactions
  - Dimension tooltips showing current panel size
  - Color-coded conflict indicators
  - Smooth transitions for content reflow

- State persistence
  - Automatic layout saving after modifications
  - Local storage integration for layout persistence
